## From script *<small>recommended</small>*

cdev has an installer script that takes the latest version of cdev and installs it for you locally.<br> You can fetch the script and execute it locally:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shalb/cluster.dev/master/scripts/get_cdev.sh | bash
```

!!! tip

    We recommend installation from script as the easiest and the quickest way to have cdev installed. For other options, please see [cdev Install Reference](https://cluster.dev/cdev-installation-reference/) section.
